> **WARNING** The "libft" project follows the norms set by the school 42, which some people may not agree with. Some users may feel that the structure of the project does not look aesthetically pleasing or intuitive due to the constraints imposed by these norms. However, it is important to remember that the purpose of the "libft" project is to teach students certain programming concepts and techniques, and the strict adherence to the norms set by the school is necessary to ensure that students are able to learn these concepts effectively.
